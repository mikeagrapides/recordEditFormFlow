# Record Edit Form LWC Component enabled for Flow

Place the recordEditFormLWC component on a flow screen. Enter all inputs in the flow parameters as you would for standard use of the lightning-record-edit-form in an LWC.

This replaces having to replaces creating "screen input" fields in a flow and using the create record flow action.
