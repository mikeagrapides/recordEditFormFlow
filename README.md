## LWC lightning-record-edit-form enabled for visual flow

Place the recordEditFormLWC component on a flow screen. Enter all inputs in the flow parameters as you would for standard use of the lightning-record-edit-form in an LWC.

This replaces having to create "screen inputs" in a flow and using create record flow actions. You can use this component to create new records or edit existing records.  

Any object supported by salesforce user interface api will work with this component.
